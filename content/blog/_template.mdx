## Main Section Heading

### Subheading for Detail

If you need to break it down further, use h3 headers.

*   **List Item 1**: Use lists to break up walls of text.
*   **List Item 2**: They are easy to scan.
*   **List Item 3**: And great for step-by-step instructions.

![Alt text description for accessibility](/assets/blog/your-image-name.jpg)

*Caption: Optional caption for the image.*

const greeting = "Hello World";
console.log(greeting);
